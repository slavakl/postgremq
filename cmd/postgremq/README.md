# PostgreMQ CLI

`postgremq` is a command-line tool for installing and upgrading the PostgreMQ database schema. It has two commands: `migrate` applies the embedded SQL migrations and `status` reports the schema version.

All PostgreMQ objects live in the fixed `postgremq` schema. The CLI does not change application schemas or the connection's `search_path`.

## Installation

Requires Go 1.25 or later. From a release:

```bash
go install github.com/slavakl/postgremq/cmd/postgremq@latest
```

Or build it from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slavakl/postgremq.git
cd postgremq/cmd/postgremq
go build -o postgremq .

# Optional: put it on your PATH
mv postgremq /usr/local/bin/
```

The migrations are embedded in the binary, so it needs no other files at runtime.

## Usage

```
postgremq [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  migrate     Run database migrations
  status      Show migration status
```

`-h` / `--help` is available on every command.

### Connection string (`--dsn`)

`migrate` and `status` require `--dsn`. It accepts any connection string that pgx accepts, in URL or keyword/value form:

```bash
postgremq status --dsn "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable"
postgremq status --dsn "host=localhost port=5432 user=user dbname=mydb sslmode=require"
```

The CLI does not read a connection string from the environment itself. Settings missing from the DSN fall back to the standard libpq environment variables (`PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGSSLMODE`, ...), so you can keep the password out of the command line:

```bash
export PGPASSWORD=secret
postgremq migrate --dsn "postgres://app@db.internal:5432/mydb?sslmode=require"

# or pass a URL kept in an environment variable
postgremq migrate --dsn "$DATABASE_URL"
```

## Commands

### `migrate`

Applies pending migrations, up to the latest version embedded in the CLI. It creates the `postgremq` schema if it does not exist yet. Migrations only go up; there is no target version.

```bash
postgremq migrate --dsn <connection-string>
```

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dsn` | string | none (required) | Database connection string |

`migrate` first prints the current and latest versions. It then:

- exits with an error if the database is in a dirty state (see [Dirty state](#dirty-state));
- prints `✓ Database is up to date` and exits if no migration is pending. This includes a database already at a newer version than the CLI's latest (migrated by a newer release), which is left unchanged;
- otherwise prints `Running migrations...`, creates the `postgremq` schema if needed, and applies the pending migrations up to the latest version.

```bash
postgremq migrate --dsn "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

Output on a fresh database:

```
Current version: 0
Latest version:  1
Running migrations...
✓ Migration completed successfully
```

Output when there is nothing to do:

```
Current version: 1
Latest version:  1
✓ Database is up to date
```

### `status`

Prints the migration status. It is read-only: it does not create the `postgremq` schema or the version table, and a database without them reports version 0.

```bash
postgremq status --dsn <connection-string>
```

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dsn` | string | none (required) | Database connection string |

Migrations pending:

```
Current version: 0
Latest version:  1
Dirty:           false

⚠ Migration needed: 1 pending migration(s)
```

Up to date:

```
Current version: 1
Latest version:  1
Dirty:           false

✓ Database is up to date
```

`status` exits with code 0 whenever it can read the status, including when migrations are pending or the database is dirty. The last line depends only on the version: a dirty database shows `Dirty:           true` and then the pending or up-to-date line as usual, so a dirty database at the latest version prints `✓ Database is up to date`. Check the `Dirty` line, or run `migrate`, which refuses a dirty database.

### `completion`

Cobra's standard shell completion generator:

```bash
postgremq completion bash|zsh|fish|powershell
```

Run `postgremq completion <shell> --help` for instructions on loading the script.

## Migration tracking

The version is stored in the single-row table `postgremq.postgremq_migrations`, which `migrate` creates:

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `version` | `bigint` (primary key) | Last applied migration version |
| `dirty` | `boolean` | `true` if that migration started but did not finish |

Migrations are applied with [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) from the SQL files embedded from `mq/migrations/`.

## Required privileges

When the `postgremq` schema does not exist yet, `migrate` creates it, which needs the `CREATE` privilege on the database:

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser;
```

Without it, `migrate` fails with:

```
Error: migration failed: failed to create queue schema: ERROR: permission denied for database mydb (SQLSTATE 42501)
```

Applying migrations to an existing schema needs the privileges the migrations' DDL needs (normally: own the `postgremq` schema). `status`, and `migrate` on an up-to-date database, only need to connect, use the `postgremq` schema, and read `postgremq.postgremq_migrations` (if the schema does not exist yet, connecting is enough). Without `USAGE` on an existing `postgremq` schema both commands fail with `failed to get migration status: ERROR: permission denied for schema postgremq (SQLSTATE 42501)`.

## Errors and exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success. For `status`, this includes pending migrations and a dirty database |
| 1 | Any error: missing `--dsn`, unparsable DSN, connection failure, dirty database (`migrate`), migration failure |

On an error, stderr gets `Error: <message>`, then the command's usage text, then `<message>` again on its own line. For example:

```
Error: required flag(s) "dsn" not set
Usage:
  postgremq status [flags]

Flags:
      --dsn string   Database connection string (required)
  -h, --help         help for status

required flag(s) "dsn" not set
```

Common messages:

| Message | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| `required flag(s) "dsn" not set` | `--dsn` missing |
| `failed to connect: cannot parse ...` | The DSN is malformed |
| `failed to get migration status: failed to connect to ...` | The server cannot be reached, or authentication failed |
| `failed to get migration status: ERROR: permission denied for schema postgremq ...` | The role cannot use the `postgremq` schema |
| `database is in dirty state - manual intervention required` | See [Dirty state](#dirty-state) |
| `migration failed: migration failed: ...` | A migration failed |
| `migration failed: failed to create queue schema: ...` | The role lacks `CREATE` on the database |

### Dirty state

If a migration fails partway, golang-migrate leaves `dirty = true` with `version` set to the migration that failed. `migrate` refuses to run until you fix it:

1. Inspect the version row and the `postgremq` schema to see what the failed migration actually changed:

   ```sql
   SELECT version, dirty FROM postgremq.postgremq_migrations;
   ```

2. Bring the schema to a consistent state, then record that state:

   - If the failed migration's changes are fully in place, clear the flag:

     ```sql
     UPDATE postgremq.postgremq_migrations SET dirty = false;
     ```

   - If they are absent or have been rolled back, set the version to the previous one so the migration runs again. For version 1, delete the row so the database reads as version 0:

     ```sql
     UPDATE postgremq.postgremq_migrations SET version = <failed_version - 1>, dirty = false;
     -- for version 1:
     DELETE FROM postgremq.postgremq_migrations;
     ```

3. Run `postgremq migrate` again.

Do not just clear the flag when the migration did not complete. `migrate` and `status` would then report the database as up to date while it is missing the schema changes.

## Common workflows

### Fresh database

```bash
createdb myapp_db
postgremq migrate --dsn "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/myapp_db"
```

### CI/CD

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

postgremq status --dsn "$DATABASE_URL"    # informational; exits 0 even if migrations are pending
postgremq migrate --dsn "$DATABASE_URL"   # exits 1 on failure or a dirty database

./myapp
```

## Migrating from Go code

To run migrations at application startup instead of through the CLI, use the same functions from the Go client:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"
	postgremq "github.com/slavakl/postgremq/postgremq-go"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	pool, err := pgxpool.New(ctx, "postgres://...")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer pool.Close()

	status, err := postgremq.GetMigrationStatus(pool)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	if status.NeedsMigration {
		if err := postgremq.Migrate(pool); err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	}

	conn, err := postgremq.DialFromPool(pool)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer conn.Close()
	// publish / consume with conn
}
```

//   - ErrQueueNotFound: the queue (or topic) doesn't exist. Returned by
//     resolveTopic for an unknown queue (client-side) AND by mapPgError for
//     PMQ02 server-side errors (e.g. publish to a non-existent topic).
//   - ErrValidation: the request was rejected before any state change. Covers
//     input validation (bad arguments) AND state preconditions (e.g. delete
//     a topic that still has messages, create a duplicate exclusive queue).

// mapPgError inspects err and, if it carries a PostgreMQ SQLSTATE, wraps it
// with the matching sentinel error so callers can use errors.Is. Errors that
// are not pgconn.PgError or that carry an unrelated SQLSTATE are returned
// unchanged. nil pass-through.
//
// Both the typed sentinel and the original error are preserved in the wrap
// chain via fmt.Errorf's multi-%w (Go 1.20+). That keeps `errors.As(err,
// &pgErr)` working for callers that want the SQLSTATE, and — critically —
// keeps the retry policy's `IsRetryableError` accurate: it inspects the
// underlying *pgconn.PgError to decide whether to retry.
